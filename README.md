# DeadLyBro's [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter) Plugins

If you're reading this you should either change this README,
or you should run `npx degit uwu/shelter-template shelter-plugins`!

You should be using pnpm with this template ideally.

You can build all plugins with `pnpm lune ci`.

# For developers:

## Installing:
```
npm i -g @uwu/lune
```
or (recommended;)

npm i @uwu/lune
```

# Plugins
## BBCode to Html/Css
Copy/Paste to [Shelter](https://github.com/uwu/shelter) > Add Plugin modal;
```
https://deadlybro.github.io/shelter-plugins/dist/BBCode%20to%20Html%20Css
```
Notes:
I don't think BBCode to Html/Css is useful work, but I would like to thank anyone who helps to develop it. You can open your bug/error reports on the Issue page at any time.
Also there is error for me; that is if we edit message, Discord crash. 
But if another user edit, it's no problem. 
If you want to edit a message, change page quickly after edit the message, or Discord will crash. 
Of course, this was the error that happened to me, I don't know how it happens to others.
