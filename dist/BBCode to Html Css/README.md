# BBCode to Html Css
This plugin simply replaces BBCodes to HTML/CSS code in Chat. 
It's work on chat page, I disabled it for other pages. 
If you want to enable, edit MESSAGE_QUERY.

Since I don't have much coding knowledge, I got some codes from another repo (shelter part) and for the CSS part, I got AI's assistance so the replace order is complicated.
